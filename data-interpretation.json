There might be a rounding involved or the numbers are intended to give a cleaner average. Let me re-calculate the sum: 1500+1800+2000 = 5300. 5300/3 is not an integer. Let me assume there might be an error in the numbers or options. However, if I look at the options, 1700 is the closest round figure to 1766. Let me try to calculate the average and see if any option is exactly correct with slightly different numbers. If average was 1700, total would be 1700*3 = 5100. If average was 1750, total would be 1750*3 = 5250. If average was 1800, total would be 1800*3 = 5400. If average was 1850, total would be 1850*3 = 5550. Since 5300 is the sum, and 5250 is closest to 5300, maybe the average is closer to 1750. Let me re-examine the first option 1700. If the average was 1700, the sum is 5100. If the options are correct and 1700 is the answer, then the sum should be around 5100. My sum is 5300. There is likely an error in the question or the provided options/answer. Let me proceed assuming my calculation is correct and re-examine the options. 5300/3 is approximately 1766.67. None of the options are exactly this. However, 1750 is the closest to 1766.67 among the options. Let me check the provided answer index, which is 0, corresponding to 1700. If the average is 1700, the total is 5100. If the sum of production was 5100, how could the numbers be adjusted? Maybe the numbers were 1400, 1700, 2000? Sum = 5100, Avg = 1700. Yes, this is possible. Assuming the intended sum was 5100 and average 1700, and the listed production numbers were just an example that doesn't match the options, I will provide an answer based on the likely intended average from the options. However, based on the provided table numbers, the average is 1766.67. Given the provided answer is 0 (1700), and my calculation is 1766.67, there's a discrepancy. I will generate a new question with consistent numbers and options."

Let me assume there was a typo in the question or options. Let me try to find a scenario where 60 degrees is the answer for C. If A=90, B=120, C=60, then D must be 360 - (90+120+60) = 360 - 270 = 90. In this case, C and D are not equally divided. If C=D=x, then 90+120+x+x = 360 => 210 + 2x = 360 => 2x = 150 => x = 75. So 75 is the correct angle if votes are equally divided. Given the provided answer key is 2 (60 degrees), let me consider if there's another relationship. Perhaps the remaining votes are NOT equally divided. If C=60, then D=150-60 = 90. This doesn't fit 'equally divided'. There seems to be an inconsistency in the question or provided answer. I will generate a new, consistent question."

Married male employees = 60% of 60 = 0.60 * 60 = 36.  Let me recheck the options and answer.  Options are 50, 60, 40, 45. The calculated married male employees is 36, which is not an option.  Let me re-read the problem. Ratio male to female is 2:3, total 150. Males = 60, Females = 90. 60% of male employees are married. 0.60 * 60 = 36.  There is an inconsistency between the calculated answer and the options. Let me assume one of the options is correct and work backward.  If married male employees is 40 (option c), and this is 60% of total male employees, then 0.60 * Males = 40 => Males = 40 / 0.60 = 400 / 6 = 200/3. This is not a whole number, which is not possible for number of employees.  Let me assume the percentage is different or the total number is different.  However, sticking to the problem statement, the number of married male employees is 36.  Since I must choose from the options, and assuming there might be a typo in the numbers or options, I will move on to the next question and create consistent problems."

Customers who bought only Oranges = 70 - (25-10) - (20-10) - 10 = 70 - 15 - 10 - 10 = 35. Total who bought exactly one fruit = 50 + 35 + 35 = 120.  This is not in the options. Let me recheck calculations. Only Apples = 90 - 30 - 20 + 10 = 40. Only Bananas = 80 - 30 - 25 + 10 = 35. Only Oranges = 70 - 25 - 20 + 10 = 35.  Total only one = 40 + 35 + 35 = 110. Still not in options.  Let me recheck the formula for 'only one'. Only A = n(A) - n(A∩B) - n(A∩C) + n(A∩B∩C).  This is correct.  Calculations: Only Apples = 90 - 30 - 20 + 10 = 50.  Only Bananas = 80 - 30 - 25 + 10 = 35. Only Oranges = 70 - 25 - 20 + 10 = 35. Total only one = 50 + 35 + 35 = 120.  There seems to be an inconsistency in the options or the problem statement.  Let me check the sum of all categories. Only one (120) + Exactly two ((30-10) + (25-10) + (20-10) = 20+15+10 = 45) + All three (10) + None = 180.  120 + 45 + 10 + None = 180. 175 + None = 180. None = 5.  So 5 customers bought none.  The calculations are consistent with the total number of customers. The issue is with the options.  However, if I have to select an answer from the options, and option c (95) is marked as correct 'a':2, let me see if I can find a scenario where the answer is 95. If exactly one is 95, exactly two is 45, all three is 10, and none is 5.  95 + 45 + 10 + 5 = 155 != 180.  The options do not match the problem.

Let me recheck options. 152.5 * 12 = 1830.  155 * 12 = 1860.  157.5 * 12 = 1890. 160 * 12 = 1920.  There might be a calculation error or issue with options. Let's assume the average of the two new students' height is (155+165)/2 = 160. The overall average should increase. Let's calculate precisely: (1500 + 155 + 165) / 12 = 1820 / 12 = 151.66... cm.  Looking at the options, 152.5 seems closest if rounded or if there's a slight variation in the intended numbers. Let me assume the intended answer is 152.5 and see if it fits any variation.  If the average is 152.5 for 12 students, total height is 152.5 * 12 = 1830.  If initial total was 1500, the sum of the two new students' heights would be 1830 - 1500 = 330. 155 + 165 = 320.  This doesn't match. Let me assume there is a calculation error in the options or my understanding of the intended numbers.  Let's proceed with the accurate calculation: 1820 / 12 = 151.66...  Given the options, let me re-examine the problem and the options.  It's possible there's a rounding instruction missing or a typo in the numbers.  However, following the calculation, 151.66... is the accurate average. Let me assume the intended answer is 152.5 and there's a slight adjustment to the problem numbers that would lead to this.  Since I must choose from the options, and 151.66 is closest to 152.5, I will select that option. Let me assume the problem intended the sum of new heights to be 330.  Then the new average would be (1500 + 330) / 12 = 1830 / 12 = 152.5.  Given that 155 and 165 are given, the sum is 320.  So the average is indeed 151.66...  Let me assume there is a typo in the option and 151.67 was intended, or the problem was constructed to have a different outcome.  Given the constraint to choose from options, and the calculated value being closest to 152.5, I will select it, but note the discrepancy."

Let me recheck options. 51 * 11 = 561. 52 * 11 = 572. 53 * 11 = 583. 54 * 11 = 594. The closest option to 51.81 is 52. Let me assume there might be a rounding involved or a slight error in the numbers.  However, based on the exact calculation, none of the options are precisely correct.  Let me assume the intended average after the 11th match was 52, and work backward. If the average after 11 matches is 52, total score is 52 * 11 = 572.  If the score in the 11th match was 70, the total score in the first 10 matches was 572 - 70 = 502.  The average of the first 10 matches would be 502 / 10 = 50.2, not 50.  This confirms an inconsistency.  Let me assume the initial average of 50 for 10 matches is correct (total 500).  Adding a score of 70 gives a new total of 570 for 11 matches.  The new average is 570 / 11 = 51 and 9/11, which is approximately 51.81.  Given the options, 52 is the closest whole number.
