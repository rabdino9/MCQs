There might be a rounding involved or the numbers are intended to give a cleaner average. Let me re-calculate the sum: 1500+1800+2000 = 5300. 5300/3 is not an integer. Let me assume there might be an error in the numbers or options. However, if I look at the options, 1700 is the closest round figure to 1766. Let me try to calculate the average and see if any option is exactly correct with slightly different numbers. If average was 1700, total would be 1700*3 = 5100. If average was 1750, total would be 1750*3 = 5250. If average was 1800, total would be 1800*3 = 5400. If average was 1850, total would be 1850*3 = 5550. Since 5300 is the sum, and 5250 is closest to 5300, maybe the average is closer to 1750. Let me re-examine the first option 1700. If the average was 1700, the sum is 5100. If the options are correct and 1700 is the answer, then the sum should be around 5100. My sum is 5300. There is likely an error in the question or the provided options/answer. Let me proceed assuming my calculation is correct and re-examine the options. 5300/3 is approximately 1766.67. None of the options are exactly this. However, 1750 is the closest to 1766.67 among the options. Let me check the provided answer index, which is 0, corresponding to 1700. If the average is 1700, the total is 5100. If the sum of production was 5100, how could the numbers be adjusted? Maybe the numbers were 1400, 1700, 2000? Sum = 5100, Avg = 1700. Yes, this is possible. Assuming the intended sum was 5100 and average 1700, and the listed production numbers were just an example that doesn't match the options, I will provide an answer based on the likely intended average from the options. However, based on the provided table numbers, the average is 1766.67. Given the provided answer is 0 (1700), and my calculation is 1766.67, there's a discrepancy. I will generate a new question with consistent numbers and options."
