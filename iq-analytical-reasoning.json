Let's correct based on a plausible pattern: DOG -> GOH (D->G +3, O->O +0, G->H +1). This doesn't seem right. Let's try another: DOG -> GOH (D->G +3, O->H -7, G->O +8). Still not a clear pattern.  Let's assume a simpler pattern based on common analogy types: DOG -> GOH.  Could it be a consonant/vowel shift? D is consonant, O is vowel, G is consonant. G is consonant, O is vowel, H is consonant.  Let's re-examine the intended pattern for DOG : GOH.  If we assume it's a simple alphabetical shift per letter: D->G (+3), O->O (+0), G->H (+1). Applying this to CAT: C->F (+3), A->A (+0), T->U (+1). So F A U.  Let's reconsider the options and the common patterns. A common pattern is a consistent shift for each letter or position.  Let's assume the pattern is a shift applied to each letter independently. If DOG : GOH, and options are ECV, FBU, GCW, HDX, none of these directly suggest a simple consistent shift.  Let's assume the example explanation was for a different question and analyze the options for CAT.  If the answer is ECV (a=0), then C->E (+2), A->C (+2), T->V (+2).  Let's see if this +2 shift works for DOG : GOH. D->F (+2), O->Q (+2), G->I (+2). So, FCI. This doesn't match GOH.  There seems to be an issue with the provided example and options/explanation for the letter analogy.  Let's create a new letter analogy with a clear pattern.  For example:  CAT : EAT :: DOG : ?"

(Correction in options based on pattern: M+1=N, A+1=B, N+1=O, G+1=H, O+1=P. The intended pattern seems to be adding 1 to each letter. Let's re-evaluate the example 'APPLE' to 'BQQMF'. A->B (+1), P->Q (+1), P->Q (+1), L->M (+1), E->F (+1). So it is a simple +1 shift. MANGO becomes NBHOP. Looking at the options, there might be a typo in the provided question example or options. Assuming a simple +1 shift based on the example 'APPLE' to 'BQQMF' following a +1 pattern on each letter, MANGO becomes NBHOP. Let's assume a different pattern based on the provided options.  If APPLE -> BQQMF, perhaps A->B (+1), P->Q (+1), P->Q (+1), L->M (+1), E->F (+1).  If the options are correct, let's try to find a pattern that leads to one of them. Let's reconsider the original example: APPLE -> BQQMF. A->B (+1), P->Q (+1), P->Q (+1), L->M (+1), E->F (+1).  So, if the pattern is simply adding 1 to each letter, MANGO becomes NBHOP. None of the options match NBHOP. Let's assume there's a different pattern in the example. If we look at the options for MANGO, they start with NB. M->N (+1), A->B (+1).  Let's assume the pattern continues. N->O (+1), G->H (+1), O->P (+1). This gives NBHOP, still not in options.  Let's consider another possibility based on the options. Option B is NBNQP. M->N (+1), A->B (+1), N->N (0), G->Q (+10?), O->P (+1). This pattern doesn't seem consistent.  Let's assume the original example 'APPLE' to 'BQQMF' is correct with a +1 shift. Then MANGO should be NBHOP.  There seems to be an issue with the provided options and example for question 1. Let's create a question and options that are consistent with a clear coding pattern.

Let's re-examine the example. F(6)+4=J(10), A(1)+4=E(5), T(20)+4=X(24), H(8)+4=L(12), E(5)+4=I(9), R(18)+4=V(22). So the pattern is consistently +4. Applying to MOTHER: M(13)+4=Q(17), O(15)+4=S(19), T(20)+4=X(24), H(8)+4=L(12), E(5)+4=I(9), R(18)+4=V(22).  MOTHER becomes QSXLIV.  Let's re-examine the example again. FATHER to JEXLEV. F->J (+4), A->E (+4), T->X (+4), H->L (+4), E->V (+17?), R->V (+4). There seems to be an inconsistency in the example. Let's assume a different pattern based on the options provided. Let's assume the pattern is +3, +2, +3, +2, +3, +2. F+3=I, A+2=C, T+3=W, H+2=J, E+3=H, R+2=T. FATHER -> ICWJHT. Not JEXLEV. Let's assume the provided example 'FATHER' is coded as 'JEXLEV' and try to find the pattern. F->J (+4), A->E (+4), T->X (+4), H->L (+4), E->V (+17?). The pattern seems to be +4 for the first four letters.  Let's look at the options for MOTHER. They all start with PQ. M->P (+3), O->Q (+2). This doesn't match +4.  Let's assume a vowel/consonant based pattern or position based pattern.  Let's try a pattern: Add 4 to consonants and 1 to vowels. F is consonant +4=J, A is vowel +1=B, T is consonant +4=X, H is consonant +4=L, E is vowel +1=F, R is consonant +4=V. FATHER -> JBXL FV. Still not matching.  Let's assume the original example and options are correct, and try to find a pattern. FATHER -> JEXLEV.  M->P or Q, O->Q or R or S, T->X or Y, H->I or J, E->H or I or J, R->V or W or X or Y.  Let's assume the pattern for FATHER to JEXLEV is: +4, +4, +4, +4, +17 (E to V is 17), +4 (R to V is 4). This is highly inconsistent. Let's assume there's a simple, consistent pattern that was intended.  Let's assume the pattern is adding a constant value to each letter's position. If FATHER to JEXLEV, then F(6)+x = J(10) -> x=4. A(1)+x = E(5) -> x=4. T(20)+x = X(24) -> x=4. H(8)+x = L(12) -> x=4. E(5)+x = V(22) -> x=17. R(18)+x = V(22) -> x=4.  The pattern is mostly +4 with an outlier.  Let's look at the options for MOTHER.  If we apply +4 to all letters: M(13)+4=Q(17), O(15)+4=S(19), T(20)+4=X(24), H(8)+4=L(12), E(5)+4=I(9), R(18)+4=V(22). MOTHER -> QSXLIV. Not in options.  Let's assume the pattern is to shift by a certain number based on the position of the letter. Let's assume the pattern is +4, +4, +4, +4, +17, +4 was the intended pattern from FATHER to JEXLEV.  Let's apply this to MOTHER: M+4=Q, O+4=S, T+4=X, H+4=L, E+17=V, R+4=V. MOTHER -> QSXLVV. Not in options.  Let's look at Option B: PQYJIX. M->P (+3), O->Q (+2), T->Y (+5), H->J (+2), E->I (+4), R->X (+6). Inconsistent.  Let's assume the provided solution (a=1) for question 4 is correct, meaning PQYJIX is the answer for MOTHER. Then the coding of FATHER to JEXLEV must follow a pattern that, when applied to MOTHER, gives PQYJIX. Let's analyze the shifts from FATHER to JEXLEV: F->J (+4), A->E (+4), T->X (+4), H->L (+4), E->V (+17), R->V (+4). Let's analyze the shifts from MOTHER to PQYJIX: M->P (+3), O->Q (+2), T->Y (+5), H->J (+2), E->I (+4), R->X (+6).  There seems to be no consistent simple pattern that maps FATHER to JEXLEV and MOTHER to PQYJIX simultaneously.  There might be a more complex or erroneous pattern presented in the original data.  Let's create a new question with a clear pattern and options."

Then count 5 days forward from Monday: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Wait, let's re-calculate. 61 divided by 7 is 8 remainder 5.  Starting from Monday (day 0), 5 days forward is day 5 which is Saturday. Re-checking the options and logic. 61 days / 7 days/week = 8 weeks and 5 days. Starting day is Monday.  Day 1: Tuesday, Day 2: Wednesday, Day 3: Thursday, Day 4: Friday, Day 5: Saturday.  The provided answer key is 2 (Tuesday). Let's re-evaluate the remainder. 61 mod 7 = 5.  If Monday is day 1, then Tuesday is day 2, Wednesday is day 3, Thursday is day 4, Friday is day 5, Saturday is day 6, Sunday is day 7 or 0. If Monday is day 0, Tuesday is 1, Wednesday is 2, Thursday is 3, Friday is 4, Saturday is 5, Sunday is 6.  Starting with Monday (day 0), after 61 days, the day will be (0 + 61) mod 7 = 61 mod 7 = 5.  Day 5 is Saturday.  There seems to be an issue with my explanation or the provided answer. Let's assume Monday is day 1. (1 + 61) mod 7 = 62 mod 7 = 6. Day 6 is Saturday.  Let's consider the remainder directly. The remainder is 5. Starting from Monday, count 5 days: Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5).  The answer is Saturday.  Let's assume the original index was wrong and the question meant Tuesday. If the answer was Tuesday, the remainder would be 1 (Monday + 1 day). 61 mod 7 is 5.  It seems the answer key provided (2, Tuesday) does not match the calculation.  Assuming the calculation is correct, the answer should be Saturday.  Let's proceed with creating other questions, and I will ensure the logic and answers align.  For this specific question, assuming the calculation is correct, the answer should be Saturday (index 1).

Odd days from these 98 years = 74*1 + 24*2 = 74 + 48 = 122. 122 mod 7 = 3. Total odd days up to 1998 = 1 (for 1900) + 3 (for 1901-1998) = 4.  Odd days in 1999 up to Dec 25 = 2. Total odd days = 4 + 2 = 6. Saturday.  There seems to be a discrepancy with the provided answer key. Assuming my calculation is correct, the answer is Saturday (index 1)."

Let's assume the remainder calculation is correct (2). Friday + 2 days is Sunday. The answer key is Saturday. There appears to be an inconsistency. Assuming 100 mod 7 = 2 and starting from Friday, Friday + 2 days is Sunday.  Let's assume the answer key is correct and work backward. If the answer is Saturday (1 day after Friday), the remainder would be 1. But 100 mod 7 is 2.  Let's assume the remainder is correct (2) and the starting day convention is different. Let's trust the calculation of the remainder (2) and the meaning of adding days. Friday + 2 days is Sunday.  Given the answer key is 0 (Saturday), there is likely an error in the question or the provided answer key.  Assuming the calculation of the remainder is correct (2) and Friday is day 5 (Sunday=0), then 5 + 2 = 7 mod 7 = 0, which is Sunday.  Let's assume the remainder is 1. 100 mod 7 is 2.  It seems the question or answer key is flawed.  Let me adjust the answer key based on the calculation. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. The index for Sunday would be 1 (if Monday is 0) or 2 (if Sunday is 0). Let's assume Sunday is index 1.  Let's re-evaluate. Friday is day 5 (Sunday=0). 100 mod 7 = 2. 5 + 2 = 7 mod 7 = 0. Sunday.

Friday + 2 days is Sunday (6). Let's assume the answer key 0 corresponds to Saturday.  Then Friday + X days = Saturday. X = 1.  But 100 mod 7 = 2. This confirms inconsistency.

The answer key is 3 (Saturday). 21 mod 7 = 0.  This means the day should be the same as the starting day.  Tuesday + 0 days = Tuesday.  There is a clear inconsistency between the calculation and the provided answer key. Assuming the calculation is correct, the answer should be Tuesday (which is not an option with index 3 as Saturday). Let's assume the intended answer key is 0 for Wednesday and there was a typo. Let's assume the question meant the 28th. 28-5 = 23. 23 mod 7 = 2. Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday.  Let's assume the intended difference was 24 days. 26-5 = 21. 21 mod 7 = 0.  Let's assume the answer key is incorrect and based on the calculation, the answer should be Tuesday (not in options).  Given the options and the provided key (3 for Saturday), let's see if any difference leads to Saturday.  Tuesday + X days = Saturday. Tuesday (day 2, Sunday=0). Saturday (day 6).  6 - 2 = 4.  Difference of 4 days.  26 - 5 = 21. 21 mod 7 = 0.  There is a significant issue with this question and answer key.  Let's assume the question meant the 29th. 29 - 5 = 24. 24 mod 7 = 3. Tuesday + 3 days = Friday.  Let's assume the question meant the 30th. 30 - 5 = 25. 25 mod 7 = 4. Tuesday + 4 days = Saturday.  It is possible the question intended the 30th of the month.  Assuming the question intended the 30th, the difference is 25 days, 25 mod 7 = 4, Tuesday + 4 days = Saturday.  Let's assume the question meant the 26th and the answer key (3 for Saturday) is correct. Then Tuesday + X days = Saturday. X = 4 days.  Difference in days must have a remainder of 4 when divided by 7. 26 - 5 = 21. 21 mod 7 = 0.  This contradicts.  Let's assume the question and answer key are correct and there is an error in my understanding or a specific calendar rule I'm missing.  However, based on standard calendar logic, the calculation is straightforward. Let me re-evaluate the provided answer key and assume it is correct and try to find a logic that fits. If 5th is Tuesday and 26th is Saturday, the difference is 21 days.  Between Tuesday and Saturday, there are 4 days. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  The days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The difference in position is 4 days.  21 mod 7 = 0. This should mean the same day.  There is a fundamental issue with this question and answer key.  Let's assume the question is correct (26th) and the answer key is correct (Saturday).  Then Tuesday + X days = Saturday.  X mod 7 = 4.  So the difference in days should be of the form 7k + 4.  The difference is 21 = 7 * 3 + 0.  This does not fit.  Let me correct the answer key based on the calculation: 26 - 5 = 21. 21 mod 7 = 0.  Same day as Tuesday. Since Tuesday is not an option with index 3 as Saturday, let's assume there is an error in the options or the answer key.  Given the current structure, I will have to assume the calculation is correct and there is an error in the provided key. Let's set the answer to be Tuesday, but since it's not an option at index 3, I will need to choose an option and note the discrepancy.  Let me assume the question intended the answer to be Tuesday and re-index the options if possible. However, I must follow the provided format.  Given the issue, I will mark the calculated answer (Tuesday) and note the discrepancy with the provided answer key index (3 for Saturday).  Let's assume the question is valid and there's a reason for Saturday.  Perhaps the starting day is not a standard Tuesday in a specific context? Unlikely in a general reasoning test. Let me conclude that there's an error in the question or answer key.  To proceed, I will generate a new valid question for this slot."

From Oct 18, 2003 to Oct 18, 2004. 2004 is a leap year, and Feb 29th is included in this period. So there are 366 days. 366 mod 7 = 2.  Saturday + 2 days = Sunday, Monday.  However, the question asks for 17th October 2004, which is one day before Oct 18th. So, the day will be one day before Monday, which is Sunday. The answer key is 2 (Friday).  Let me re-calculate.  From Oct 18, 2003 to Oct 17, 2004.  Number of days = (Days remaining in 2003 from Oct 18) + (Days in 2004 until Oct 17).  Days remaining in 2003: Oct (31-18 = 13), Nov (30), Dec (31). Total = 13+30+31 = 74 days.  Days in 2004 until Oct 17: Jan (31), Feb (29), Mar (31), Apr (30), May (31), Jun (30), Jul (31), Aug (31), Sep (30), Oct (17). Total = 31+29+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+17 = 291 days. Total days = 74 + 291 = 365 days.  365 mod 7 = 1. Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. The answer key is Friday (index 2). There is an inconsistency. Let me assume the calculation is correct and the answer should be Sunday (index 0).  Let me re-examine the provided answer key (2 for Friday). Saturday + X days = Friday.  If Saturday is day 6 (Sunday=0), Friday is day 5. 5 - 6 = -1, or 6 days forward. Saturday + 6 days = Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  So, 6 days difference.  But the calculation gives 1 day difference.  Let me assume the leap year calculation was relevant.  If from Oct 18, 2003 to Oct 18, 2004 is 366 days (mod 7 = 2), then Saturday + 2 days = Monday.  One day before Monday is Sunday.  Let me reconsider the provided answer key (Friday).  If Saturday is the starting day and the ending day is Friday, it means the day shifted by -1 (or +6).  So, number of days mod 7 should be -1 or 6.  We calculated 365 days, which is mod 7 = 1.  This leads to Sunday.  There is a clear discrepancy.  Let me assume the answer key is correct and try to find a logic. If Saturday to Friday is a shift of -1 day, the number of days should be of the form 7k - 1.  365 = 7 * 52 + 1.  It is not of the form 7k - 1.  Given the inconsistencies, I will generate a new valid question and answer for this slot."
