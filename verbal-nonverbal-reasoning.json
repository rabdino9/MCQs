Conversely, an increase in import duty (Statement I) could also lead to higher domestic prices (Statement II). However, it's also possible both are effects of a common cause like poor domestic harvest or global price rise. Option 4 (effects of some common cause) or even I is cause and II is effect, or II is cause and I is effect are plausible. Given the options, if domestic prices are already high (II), the government might increase import duty (I) to curb cheap imports or raise revenue. Or, if import duty is increased (I), domestic prices (II) will likely rise. Let's consider if II (high domestic price) is a reason for I (increase import duty). This is less direct. More likely, if import duty (I) is increased, it makes imported sugar costlier, allowing domestic prices (II) to rise or stay high. So I could be a cause for II. However, if domestic prices (II) are already high due to, say, low production, the government might increase import duty (I) to protect farmers, but this would further increase prices. A common cause like 'government policy to support domestic sugar industry' could lead to both. Let's re-evaluate. If domestic prices (II) are high, the government might increase import duty (I) to discourage imports and protect local producers, or to raise revenue. This makes II a cause for I. Alternatively, if the government increases import duty (I), it makes imported sugar more expensive, which can lead to an increase in domestic sugar prices (II). This makes I a cause for II. If both are plausible, consider 'effects of some common cause'. A poor domestic harvest (common cause) could lead to high domestic prices (II) AND the government increasing import duty (I) to manage the situation or protect remaining farmers. This seems like a strong possibility for 'common cause'."
