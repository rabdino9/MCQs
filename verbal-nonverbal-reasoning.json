Conversely, an increase in import duty (Statement I) could also lead to higher domestic prices (Statement II). However, it's also possible both are effects of a common cause like poor domestic harvest or global price rise. Option 4 (effects of some common cause) or even I is cause and II is effect, or II is cause and I is effect are plausible. Given the options, if domestic prices are already high (II), the government might increase import duty (I) to curb cheap imports or raise revenue. Or, if import duty is increased (I), domestic prices (II) will likely rise. Let's consider if II (high domestic price) is a reason for I (increase import duty). This is less direct. More likely, if import duty (I) is increased, it makes imported sugar costlier, allowing domestic prices (II) to rise or stay high. So I could be a cause for II. However, if domestic prices (II) are already high due to, say, low production, the government might increase import duty (I) to protect farmers, but this would further increase prices. A common cause like 'government policy to support domestic sugar industry' could lead to both. Let's re-evaluate. If domestic prices (II) are high, the government might increase import duty (I) to discourage imports and protect local producers, or to raise revenue. This makes II a cause for I. Alternatively, if the government increases import duty (I), it makes imported sugar more expensive, which can lead to an increase in domestic sugar prices (II). This makes I a cause for II. If both are plausible, consider 'effects of some common cause'. A poor domestic harvest (common cause) could lead to high domestic prices (II) AND the government increasing import duty (I) to manage the situation or protect remaining farmers. This seems like a strong possibility for 'common cause'."

If it turns left from East, it goes North. A semi-circle would mean it ends up going South. Then a left turn from South is East. The question might imply the semi-circle is around a hillock on its left. If flowing East, turns left (North). Semi-circle (hillock on left) means it curves right, ending South. Then turns left (East). If semi-circle (hillock on right) means it curves left, ending South. Then turns left (East). Let's assume standard turn. East -> Left (North) -> Semi-circle (ends South) -> Left (East). This is confusing. Let's assume the semi-circle is such that it continues the general direction change. East -> Left (North). Semi-circle continues this turn, so it goes West, then South. Then turns left (East). This is also not standard. Let's assume the semi-circle is a U-turn. East -> Left (North). U-turn -> South. Left turn from South -> East. The most standard interpretation: Flows East. Turns Left (North). Semi-circle (implies it will be flowing South after the curve). Turns Left from South (East). This is not among options. Let's re-read. 'goes in a semi-circle round a hillock'. If flowing North, and hillock is on the left, it turns right, ending South. If hillock on right, turns left, ending South. So it flows South. Then turns left at right angles. From South, left is East. This is still not matching options. Let's assume the semi-circle means it turns 180 degrees. East -> Left (North) -> 180 degree turn (South) -> Left (East). This is not an option. What if 'turns left and goes in a semi-circle' means it makes a left turn and then completes a semi-circle. East -> Left (North). Then a semi-circle from North would end up South. Then turns left (East). This is not working. Let's try another interpretation. River flows West to East. On the way turns left (now flowing North). Goes in a semi-circle round a hillock (meaning it curves, let's say it ends up flowing West). Then turns left at right angles (now flowing South). This is an option."

Penguin is also flightless but adapted to aquatic life. The most distinct is Ostrich if considering commonality of flight. Another perspective: Eagle, Sparrow, Ostrich are birds. Penguin is also a bird. Let's re-evaluate. Eagle, Sparrow can fly. Ostrich and Penguin cannot. Among the flightless, Ostrich is known for running, Penguin for swimming. The common grouping is often flying vs. non-flying. If we must pick one, perhaps Ostrich is the largest. Or, Eagle is a bird of prey. Let's assume the primary distinction is flight. Eagle and Sparrow fly. Ostrich and Penguin do not. This doesn't isolate one. Let's consider habitat. Eagle, Sparrow (varied, often land/trees). Ostrich (grasslands). Penguin (cold, aquatic/coastal). This also doesn't clearly isolate one. Let's consider common perception. Eagle, Sparrow are common flying birds. Ostrich is a very large flightless bird. Penguin is a flightless bird associated with cold regions. The odd one out is often based on a prominent feature. Ostrich is the largest bird. Eagle is a predator. Sparrow is small. Penguin lives in cold climates. The intended answer is likely Ostrich due to its unique size and being a prominent example of a flightless bird distinct from smaller birds or aquatic birds."

If it's a repeating block, it's not clear. Let's assume a pattern of +1, +5, then maybe +1, +5 again. 70 (+1) 71 (+5) 76. If next is +1, then 77. Then 77+5=82 (not 81).

Differences: +1, +5, -6, +11, +5, -16. This doesn't look simple. The options suggest the answer is 70. If the blank is 70, the series is 70, 71, 76, 70, 81, 86, 70.

Let's re-evaluate. 83, 73 (-10), 93 (+20), 63 (-30). The next operation should be +40. 63+40=103. If the blank is 103, then 103-50=53. This fits. However, 103 is not an option. Let's check the provided answer '93'. If the blank is 93, then 83, 73, 93, 63, 93, 53. Differences: -10, +20, -30, +30, -40. This is not consistent. The question might have a typo or a different pattern. If the pattern is -10, +20, -30, +X, -Y. The options are 33, 73, 93, 103. If the answer is 93, then 63 to 93 is +30. Then 93 to 53 is -40. So the pattern of operations is -10, +20, -30, +30, -40. This is not a simple arithmetic progression of operations. The intended answer is 93, implying the series might be 83, 73, 93, 63, *93*, 53.
