It saw the transition from agrarian and handicraft economies to those dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. Key developments included the invention of the steam engine, the power loom, and the cotton gin. These inventions led to the growth of factories, the mass production of goods, and the movement of people from rural areas to urban centers in search of work. While the Industrial Revolution brought about increased productivity and wealth, it also led to significant social changes, including the rise of a new working class, poor living conditions in overcrowded cities, and child labor. The shift from skilled craftspeople to factory workers also transformed the nature of work.

They are built by tiny animals called coral polyps, which secrete calcium carbonate to form hard exoskeletons. Over time, these exoskeletons accumulate to create the intricate structures of the reef. Coral reefs are often called the 'rainforests of the sea' because of their incredible biodiversity. They provide habitat and food for thousands of species of fish, invertebrates, and other marine organisms. However, coral reefs are facing serious threats, primarily from climate change, which causes ocean warming and acidification, leading to coral bleaching. Pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices also contribute to reef degradation. Protecting coral reefs is crucial not only for marine ecosystems but also for the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on them for food and tourism.\n\nWhat is the primary threat to coral reefs mentioned in the passage?",

It is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. Construction began in the 7th century BC and continued for centuries, with the most well-known sections being built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The Wall is not a single continuous barrier but rather a collection of walls, trenches, and natural barriers. Despite its impressive size and historical significance, the Great Wall was not always effective in preventing invasions.

The process begins in the mouth, where food is mechanically broken down by chewing and chemically by saliva. From the mouth, food travels down the esophagus to the stomach, where it is mixed with acidic digestive juices. The partially digested food then moves to the small intestine, where most nutrient absorption occurs. Enzymes from the pancreas and liver aid in this process. Undigested material then passes into the large intestine, where water is absorbed, and waste is formed. Finally, waste is eliminated from the body.

Over time, telescopes improved, with larger lenses and mirrors allowing astronomers to see fainter and more distant objects. The invention of the refracting telescope (using lenses) was followed by the reflecting telescope (using mirrors). The launch of space telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, in the late 20th century revolutionized astronomy by allowing observations above the Earth's atmosphere, free from distortion.
