If a girl earns Rs.400/week, let's assume this is for a certain number of working days. The relationships are given in terms of earning capacity over the same period (implied). Let's calculate daily earnings assuming a 7-day week. Girl's daily earning = 400/7. 4 boys earn as much as 5 girls, so 4 * (Boy's daily earning) = 5 * (400/7). Boy's daily earning = (5/4) * (400/7) = 500/7. 2 women earn as much as 3 boys, so 2 * (Woman's daily earning) = 3 * (500/7). Woman's daily earning = (3/2) * (500/7) = 750/7. 6 men earn as much as 7 women, so 6 * (Man's daily earning) = 7 * (750/7). 6 * (Man's daily earning) = 750. Man's daily earning = 750/6 = Rs. 125.00."
